# Node Server Without Express

I have exclusively used the express framework up to this point
to set up servers for Node.js so I wanted to make a basic self
implemented one to have a look at what is going behind the
shroud of the library.

For any practical project I will still use express because it
is much more practical I just did this to experiment.

If you have node installed you can just navigate to the
directory you clone this repo to and run it with:

    node main.js

Open the form.html in your browser to POST to the server
and edit the page2.html and page2.html files. You can
see the changes on localhost:3000/1 and localhost:3000/2
